# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook Constitution

## Core Principles

### 1. Purpose
Define how Spec-Kit Plus and Claude Code will help me create a textbook on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics, written in Docusaurus and deployed on GitHub Pages.

### 2. Project Goal
Produce a complete, structured, university-level book covering:
- Physical AI foundations
- Humanoid robotics hardware & software
- AI agents + robotics integration
All content must be Docusaurus-ready Markdown.

### 3. AI Behavior
AI should act as:
- Technical author
- Curriculum designer
- Robotics & AI expert
Tone: clear, structured, academic, simple for students.
Avoid plagiarism and hallucinations.

### 4. Output Rules
- Use clean Markdown compatible with Docusaurus.
- One concept per file (modular structure).
- Each chapter includes: intro, concepts, diagrams, examples, summary, and exercises.
- Follow consistent formatting across all chapters.

### 5. Workflow (Spec-Kit Plus)
- /constitution → define rules
- /specify → generate book requirements
- /plan → create full outline + file structure
- /tasks → break into small implementable tasks
- /implement → generate the textbook content

### 6. Tools
- Spec-Kit Plus: workflow orchestration
- Claude Code: automated writing and file generation
- GitHub Pages: final deployment

### 7. Quality Criteria
Content must be:
- Technically accurate
- Educational and beginner-friendly
- Complete and logically structured
- Ready to build via `npm run build`

### 8. Success
The project is successful when:
- The full book is generated
- Docusaurus builds with no errors
- GitHub Pages deployment works
- All chapters follow consistent style and formatting
